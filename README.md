# DeepFake Video Detector

A deep learning-based project to detect DeepFake videos using a hybrid **CNN-BiLSTM** architecture. The system supports video frame extraction and spatial-temporal modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects manipulated (DeepFake) media in  videos
- Frame-level feature extraction via **ResNet-50**
- Temporal sequence modeling via **Bidirectional LSTM**
- Supports batch training and testing
